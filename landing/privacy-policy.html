            <p>
              When you download the App and create an account, we may collect
              certain information about you, such as :
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li>

              <li>Location</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Once you register, you will be able to review and change this
              information at any time just by logging in to Clique (other than
              your phone number. It is your responsibility to ensure that your
              account details are kept up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our
              Users (robots are not welcome!). Registration Information such as
              your distance, name and photos may be visible to other Users who
              view your profile page.

            <h3>Profile Information</h3>
            <p>
              We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think
              carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. We
              also do not recommend that you put URLs, instant messaging
              details, full names or addresses, credit card details, national
              identity numbers, drivers’ license details and other sensitive
              information which is open to abuse and misuse on your profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you post information about yourself or use the messaging
              function to communicate with other Users, the amount of personal
              information you share is at your own risk. Please see Section 4
              below for more information on who can access what you post on
              Clique.

            <h3>Profile Verification Information</h3>
            <p>
              For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible
              user experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and
              might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we might
              also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make
              sure you are not a robot! And we also want to avoid fake Clique
              accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities
              and cyber crime – they threaten the Clique network and spoil
              things for everyone. This verification might be required by us for
              the prevention of fraud.

            <p>
              If you have given Clique access to your location in your device
              settings, when you use your cell, we will collect information
              about WiFi access points as well as other location information
              about your longitude and latitude and may save your device’s
              coordinates to offer certain features to you. This information
              helps us identify your physical location and we use it to
              personalize the App and make it easier for you to interact with
              other Users, by enabling the general locality information to be
              displayed to Users seeing your profile and showing you the
              profiles of other Users who are near you.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have given Clique access to your location, but wish to turn
              this off, you can do so by the following methods:

              take steps to remove personally identifying information from such

              advertising for Clique). Such surveys and marketing campaigns are

            <h3>Our Algorithms</h3>
            <p>
              Clique's mission is to build trust and relationships based on
              games and questions.. We have developed matching algorithms to
              predict your compatibility with other users so we can show you
              people we think are a good match for you. We use different
              indications based on users’ profiles on our app. We use these
              indications to recommend the most relevant profiles to everyone to
              maximize everyone’s chances of finding meaningful connections on
              our apps. We use the following data about you and other users to
              predict your compatibility with others and generate profile
              recommendations: the information you provide us about yourself in
              your profile such as age, distance or gender so we can show you
              people who are appropriate.

            <h3>Moderation Practices</h3>
            <p>
              We use a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts
              (including photos and any other information uploaded onto user
              profiles) and messages for content that indicates breaches of our
              Terms and Conditions of Use. If an account or message meets
              certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and Conditions of
              Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant account will be
              subject to a warning and the user’s access restricted and/or
              blocked. Affected Users can contact Clique to contest the
              decision.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and
              Conditions of Use, we reserve the right to terminate or restrict
              access to your Account.

          </div>
          <p>
            We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome
            you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable
            this. Our App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with
            other Users and to interact with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            When using the Clique app, you should assume that anything you post
            or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both
            by Users and non-users of the App. We want our Users to be careful
            about posting information that may eventually be made public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on
            your profile such as your religious denomination and health details.
            You may also choose to add sensitive information about yourself when
            you add certain information to your profile, such as your religion
            and political leanings. While you may voluntarily provide this
            information to us when you create your profile, including your
            sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so. Please
            remember that photographs that you post on Clique may reveal
            information about yourself as well.

            steps to terminate that person's registration.

              provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly
              within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and

              Device permissions. Mobile platforms can have permission systems
              for specific types of device data and notifications, such as
              pictures, location services, push notifications and advertising
              identifiers. You can change your settings on your device to either
              consent or oppose the collection or processing of the
              corresponding information or the display of the corresponding
              notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may

            For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may
            ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
            requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are
            unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid,
            or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or
            the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive
            information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages
            you received from them through our service, the other user will have
            to contact us to submit a separate request for their information. We
            may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer
            the request. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain
            requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal
            information, notably where such requests would not allow us to
            provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide
            our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot
            ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.
